* It is precisely when long-held assumptions about an industry are challenged that strategic changes happen.
* Strategy is not about the long term or the short term, but about the fundamentals of how the business works: 
  * Sources of value creation
  * Drivers of the cost to deliver it
  * Basis of competition
* Strategy is about what we are going to do now in order to shape the future to our advantage.
